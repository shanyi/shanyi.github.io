title: "Retrieving missing old voice memos by trimming or renaming"
categories: essays
---

I found my old voice memos in my iPhone cannot be synced to iTunes while new/recent voice memos can be synced as usual. I also found that there are many people have similar problem, some people cannot sync the old memos while others cannot sync the new ones.

For my issue, my old voice memos are still in my phone, I can only guess that they cannot be recognised anymore after the iTunes was updated. So I try to trim the memos with 0.1-0.2 secs in the beginning or in the end, and then save the trimmed one into a new file and sync again--it works. It also works when I rename the old memo by adding letters or numbers to the original file name; in this way, the time of creating the memos will stay put and the record in app is still neat by time order. So the latter method is recommended. 

Since I changed both my iPhone and my lap-top (from Samsung to Macbook Pro) this summer, and the softwares are updated to iOS 8.1 and OS X Yosemite 10.10 (14A389), I cannot tell what the problem is. I just feel uncomfortable that not everything is backed up well and up to date.

- MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)
- OS X Yosemite 10.10 (14A389)   iTunes 12.0.1.26
- iPhone 5
- iOS 8.1
